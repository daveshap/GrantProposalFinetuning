parameters from 3% below Tc(orT+in the discontinuous case) to 3% above (or from 3% above to 3% below the critical value of pfor KC model), and recording the spikes of 300 neurons along 300 time steps. We have used T= 0 or= 2 for networks showing no phase transition. For the GH model there are sev- eral cases (blue raster plots) of discontinuous transitions where there is a sharp decrease of activity after cross- ingT+. Continuous transitions with large hki(such as hki= 20,0:4), show bursts of synchronized activ- ity that disappear for Tslightly above Tc(black raster plots). For = 0 the network topology corresponds to a circle (or to a torus for larger hkivalues), so that neurons spiking at time t+ 1 are close neighbors of those spiking at timet, leading to linear wave-like propagation.

Simulations where run for 5 104time steps for each value ofTorp, increasing (black circles) or decreasing (red lines) by T= 0:005 or = 0:05. For the GH model, x-axis range is [0 : 0:3], forhki= 2, 4 and 10, and [0 :2 : 0:5] for otherhki values. For the KC model, x-axis range is p= 0:5 top= 2. y-axis range is AC(1) = 0:25 toAC(1) = 1 for both models. A thick blue dash over the upper x-axis marks a 3% range of the control parameter, about it's critical value (or T+for discontinuous transitions). The boxes remarked with dashed lines correspond to the parameters used in Figs. 2-3-4. IV. DISCUSSION Summarizing, we have revisited two simpli ed mod- els of neuronal activation to show that subtle di erences may result in very di erent collective dynamics when em- bedded on networks. We found that the KC model dy- namical repertoire includes, as a function of its control parameter, only a continuous phase transitions being, by design, insensitive to the network topology. This is at odds with the GH model, in which each neuron outcome is in uenced by its connectivity degree and therefore by the overall network topology. We have used the  rst autocorrelation coecient AC(1) of the order parameter  uctuations and the pres- ence or absence of hysteresis to identify whether a dy- namic transition is present, and to distinguish continu- ous from discontinuous transitions. This observable is sensitive enough to even being able to tune a system to- wards criticality [36]. None of the present results depend on the use of the autocorrelation to track the dynamics. 7 FIG. 7. Typical rasters of activity for networks with diverse topologies, while varying the control parameter around the critical value, for both models (GH model in panel a, KC model in b). The dots in each box denote activity of a subset of 300 neurons (ordered in the yaxis), for 300 time steps ( x axis), as the control parameter is changed continuously about the critical point. Other network parameters as in Fig. 6. Dot color matches the regions of Fig. 5. The dotted black lines indicate the limits of the parameters that exhibit phase transitions. The boxes remarked with dashed lines correspond to the parameters used in Figs. 2-3-4. The presence of phase transitions and hysteresis in these models has been studied with other observables, such as the fraction of active sites fS, the variance of activity  uctuations 2 fS, or cluster quantities such as the size of the largest or the second largest cluster ( S1, orS2) as in [11, 12], yielding similar results. We used AC(1) because its computation is straightforward and easy to replicate, it is almost parameter free, therefore very convenient for comparing the two models. The key di erence between the two models is in the rule that determines how the activity propagates from a given neuron to its connected neighbors. The GH model mimics a discrete integrate-and- re process taking place in real neurons. There, the \decision" to  re is post- synaptic, based on the amount of total depolarization, on a small patch of membrane, produced by the contri- bution of hundreds to thousands of impinging neurons (notice the sum in Eq. (1a)). Disregarding the spon- taneous activation term, the rule in the GH model is completely deterministic. In fact it is equivalent to a discretized partial di erential equation, where the state SI(t+1) of a post-synaptic neuron Iat timet+1 dependsonly on local quantities: it is determined by the previ- ous state of that neuron, SI(t), the contribution of all other presynaptic neurons J1toJkat timet, the weights Wijof the connections, and the excitation threshold, i.e., SI(t+ 1) =f[SI(t);SJ1(t);:::;SJk(t);WJi=1::k;J;T]. In contrast, in the KC model the propagation rule is a probabilistic (notice the product Eq. (2a)) contagion-like process [31], where a single excited neuron determines, according to a prescribed value of phow many of all of the neurons that connects to will  re next time. Thus, here the decision of how many neurons will be activated is presynaptic: a spiking neuron Jexcites on average ppost-synaptic Ineurons, independently of the state of the other neurons connected to the same Ineuron. Sincepaccounts already for the average out degree of the network, the rule in Eq. (2a) determines, for each Jneuron independently the probability that such active neuron will have no-descendants, one or more than one descendants. It is then rather unsurprising that the KC model is insensitive to the network topology. Although this is not the focus of the present report, it is worth to mention that the KC model rule is biologically implausible. As explained above, the actual activation mechanism of a given neuron involves a myriad of in u- ences (thousands in mammalian brains) over a very small area. In addition, one has to consider that the output of an active neuron, after propagating trough its axon from hundreds of microns to millimeters, will stimulate all its contacts roughly equally . Thus, a neuron


LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper examines the effects of network topology on two simplified models of neuronal activation, the GH model and the KC model. The GH model shows a variety of phase transitions, including both continuous and discontinuous transitions, while the KC model only shows a continuous phase transition. The autocorrelation coefficient AC(1) is used to track the dynamics and identify phase transitions. The key difference between the two models is in the rule that determines how the activity propagates from a given neuron to its connected neighbors. The GH model mimics a discrete integrate-and-fire process taking place in real neurons, while the KC model is a probabilistic contagion-like process. The KC model is insensitive to the network topology.
