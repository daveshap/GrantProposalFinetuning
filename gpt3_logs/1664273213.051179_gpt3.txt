Summarize the following paper for literature review.


PAPER:
do not believe anyone would be be put at disadvantage from this research. Nonetheless, we agree that the consequences of failure of the system would be immense, when being applied to tasks like classifying if a patient needs hospitalization. However, we do not claim that our system is free of faults at this point of research. Instead we provided a novel setup that needs to be further explored, but that can put research forth in the intersection of machine learning and logic circuits, since we motivated its exploration in a previously unseen way. We hope to trigger new ideas in the community which can have a high impact on how the aspect of interpretability in black box models is thought.

LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper explores the idea of using machine learning to interpret black box models. The authors argue that this could have a high impact on how the aspect of interpretability in black box models is thought. They provide a novel setup that needs to be further explored, but that can put research forth in the intersection of machine learning and logic circuits.
