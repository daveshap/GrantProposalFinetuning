 Making Logic Learnable With Neural Networks Tobias Brudermueller1, 2,Dennis L. Shung2,Adrian J. Stanley3,Johannes Stegmaier1, and Smita Krishnaswamy2 1Institute of Imaging and Computer Vision; RWTH Aachen University; Aachen, Germany 2Yale School of Medicine; Yale University; New Haven, CT, USA 3Glasgow Royal Inrmary; Glasgow, United Kingdom Abstract While neural networks are good at learning unspecied functions from training samples, they cannot be directly implemented in hardware and are often not inter- pretable or formally veriable. On the other hand, logic circuits are implementable, veriable, and interpretable but are not able to learn from training data in a gen- eralizable way. We propose a novel logic learning pipeline that combines the advantages of neural networks and logic circuits. Our pipeline rst trains a neural network on a classication task, and then translates this, rst to random forests, and then to AND-Inverter logic. We show that our pipeline maintains greater accu- racy than naive translations to logic, and minimizes the logic such that it is more interpretable and has decreased hardware cost. We show the utility of our pipeline on a network that is trained on biomedical data. This approach could be applied to patient care to provide risk stratication and guide clinical decision-making. 1 Introduction Neural networks, equipped with the benets of differentiable computing, have proven to be effective in learning many types of functions that translate from complex inputs to abstract outputs using training data [ 1]. However, differentiable computing is not the native language of computers, since they are built using digital logic. This discrepancy makes it difcult to implement neural networks directly in hardware [ 2]. Moreover, the language of logic has a distinct advantage in veriability. When a neural network makes a decision, it is often considered a black box, whereas a chain of logical operations can be veried for correct operation in important conditions [ 35]. On the other hand, there has been little work in learning logic [ 68]. Most efforts in logic synthesis focus on minimizing logic that starts out specied [ 913]. In this work, we seek to combine the learning process of neural networks with the advantages of logic to aid healthcare applications. Here, we bridge the gap between these two paradigms by proposing a process for learning a neural network and optimizing the resultant logic in a specic way that maintains accuracy. Our method rst learns a neural network for a classication decision, and translates it rst to a random forest, and then to a network of simple logic gates called an And-Inverter-Graph (AIG) [ 14]. We hypothesize that random forests naturally eliminate dependencies based on unseen inputs in such a way that the coverage of the logic function expands smoothly, i.e. allows us to apply the same logic decision to be applied to test vectors that are near to training vectors based on Hamming distance. Thus, we smooth the logic in this way to be more generalizable. We show that this process not only results in more efcient logic, but vastly improves the accuracy and generalizability of the logic on test data over straightforward translations to arithmetic circuits. We also show that it improves on LUT-based translations to logic that are often used in FPGAs. We explore logic learning and synthesis in the healthcare realm. In this realm there is a pressing need for a rational, data-driven approach to decision-making. For instance, decisions of whether to give Email: tobias.brudermueller@rwth-aachen.de Email: smita.krishnaswamy@yale.edu Preprint. Under review.arXiv:2002.03847v3  [cs.LG]  7 Jun 2020 certain treatments to patients, or predictions of which patients will require intensive care unit (ICU) care or ventilation can help hospitals plan and allocate resources that we see can become scarce under pandemic conditions. Further, black-box decisions are less trusted in healthcare even if they lead to accurate results. Therefore, being able to create a report of the decision as a logical inference has high value for verication and interpretation of the decision. For example instances that satisfy the criteria for a positive decision (positive disease diagnosis or intervention decision) can be generated using a SAT solver like MiniSAT [ 15]. These solutions can be veried by clinicians either using domain knowledge or historical data. Finally, recently there have been efforts in automated and continual predictions of medical diagnoses and interventions. For example continuous monitoring of respiratory status and blood oxygen levels can immediately identify critical care need [ 16] that are being implemented directly in hardware. In such cases the smaller and and more accurate logic we propose can improve online healthcare decisions in terms of hardware size and power consumption. While there are several methods that implement neural networks into logic [ 2,17], as we show, direct compilations of logic can result in inaccuracy. We train logic networks to make healthcare decisions on two datasets. The rst dataset consists of 3,012 patient observations obtained from hospitals around the world [ 18] who seek medical care for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) symptoms. A large proportion of GIB symptoms are not serious and most patients can be discharged. However, a small percentage of patients have serious issues that could result in death and must be hospitalized. Distinguishing between these two types of patients on the basis of the rst hours of measurement is vital for hospital resource allocation. The second dataset is from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (V ACS) [ 19] that collects detailed medical data about HIV infected veterans, when they visit the hospital to receive antiretroviral treatment. Here, we use a data set with 7,346 total observations to classify if the patient will survive the treatment for 6, 7 or 8 years. In


LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

This paper proposes a novel logic learning pipeline that combines the advantages of neural networks and logic circuits. The pipeline first trains a neural network on a classification task, and then translates this, first to random forests, and then to AND-Inverter logic. The authors show that this pipeline maintains greater accuracy than naive translations to logic, and minimizes the logic such that it is more interpretable and has decreased hardware cost. The paper demonstrates the utility of the pipeline on two datasets: one from hospitals around the world seeking medical care for gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms, and one from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. The authors show that the pipeline is able to accurately classify patients in both datasets, and that the resulting logic is more interpretable and easier to verify than logic resulting from other methods.
