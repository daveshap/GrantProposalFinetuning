The novelty of the proposed approach lies in that the distorted images are included in the training process in learning the reliable neutral network model, and IQA is adopted in regularizing the label distribution of training samples to obtain a more robust representation. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on image classi/f_ication and it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves high prediction accuracy across dierent distortion types and levels.REFERENCES [1]Martn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jerey Dean, Matthieu Devin, and others. 2016.

LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper proposes a quality assessment based label smoothing approach for deep neural network learning. The authors claim that the proposed approach achieves high prediction accuracy across different distortion types and levels. The approach is based on the idea that distorted images should be included in the training process in order to learn a more robust representation. Quality assessment is used to regularize the label distribution of training samples. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on image classification tasks. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approach.
