This report is concerned with the relevance of the microscopic rules, that implement individual neuronal activation, in determining the collective dynamics, under variations of the network topol- ogy. To  x ideas we study the dynamics of two cellular automaton models, commonly used, rather in-distinctively, as the building blocks of large scale neuronal networks. One model, due to Green- berg & Hastings, (GH) can be described by evolution equations mimicking an integrate-and- re process, while the other model, due to Kinouchi & Copelli, (KC) represents an abstract branching process, where a single active neuron activates a given number of postsynaptic neurons according to a prescribed \activity" branching ratio. Despite the apparent similarity between the local neuronal dynamics of the two models, it is shown that they exhibit very di erent collective dynamics as a function of the network topology. The GH model shows qualitatively di erent dynamical regimes as the network topology is varied, including transients to a ground (inactive) state, continuous and discontinuous dynamical phase transitions. In contrast, the KC model only exhibits a continuous phase transition, independently of the network topology. These results highlight the importance of paying attention to the microscopic rules chosen to model the inter-neuronal interactions in large scale numerical simulations, in particular when the network topology is far from a mean  eld de- scription. One such case is the extensive work being done in the context of the Human Connectome, where a wide variety of types of models are being used to understand the brain collective dynamics. I. INTRODUCTION The animal brain is composed by billions of neurons, which interact with each other through thousands of synapses per neuron. The results of such interaction is the emergence of complex spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity supporting perception, action and be- havior. A recent proposal considers the brain as a net- work of neurons poised near a dynamical transition [1{4], a view which is supported by experimental results gath- ered from animals both in vitro [5] and in vivo [6] as well as from whole brain neuroimaging human experiments [7{9]. The potential existence of critical phenomena in the brain motivated during the last decade the study of mathematical models to better explore the large-scale brain dynamics. A distinctive di erence between the di- versity of models is at the microscopic level. Some mod- els consist of networks of simpli ed neurons, in which neurons themselves are represented by a wide variety of approaches, ranging from 2-state particles [10] through discrete cellular automatons [11{14], branching processes[6, 15{18], neural masses [19], coupled-maps [20{23], cou- pled Kuramoto oscillators [24] up to detailed equations describing the evolution and spiking of the membrane po- tential [25{27]. Thus, a natural question arises on how relevant may the microscopic process used to represent the individual neuronal dynamics be, and how they af- fect the dynamical collective repertoire exhibited by the network. When focusing on collective properties, it is of course reasonable to seek minimal models which, even orphan of realistic microscopic rules, may reproduce relevant macroscopic behavior. However, it is not straightforward to determine in principle how general this assumption can be in the case of neuronal networks. Our point is that, even though the use of realistic microscopic dynamics is not necessarily a prerequisite to correctly describe uni- versal macroscopic properties, microscopic rules do mat- terand eventually can lead to di erent universal behav- ior. As a clarifying metaphor consider the Ising model. It is well known that algorithms with unrealistic non- local moves (so-called cluster algorithms [28]) can cor- rectly describe the static critical behavior. However, ifarXiv:2109.01614v1  [cond-mat.dis-nn]  3 Sep 2021 2 the dynamic rule did not follow detailed balance, then the modi ed dynamics would fail to reproduce equilibrium behavior, even if it could reproduce some sort of critical dynamics. And of course, even with detailed balance, the dynamical universality is altered by the non-local rule. A similar correspondence among microscopic rules and sys- tem's dynamics appears when modeling brain dynamics, which is rarely considered, thus some extrapolations to real brain dynamics taken from numerical simulations in the current literature, may be hampered by the limita- tions of the microscopic details of the neuronal models employed. We are purposely not considering here a large chapter of models that include synaptic plasticity. In this article, we illustrate the problem by studying the dynamics of two apparently similar


LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper examines the role of microscopic rules in determining the collective dynamics of a neuronal network. The authors compare the dynamics of two cellular automaton models commonly used to simulate large-scale neuronal networks. They find that the two models exhibit very different collective dynamics as a function of network topology. The results highlight the importance of paying attention to the microscopic rules chosen to model inter-neuronal interactions in large-scale numerical simulations.
