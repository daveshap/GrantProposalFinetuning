LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper presents the results of a comparison between three different machine learning models - LogicNet, Arithmetic Circuit, and Random Forest - applied to the task of image classification. The LogicNet model outperformed the other two models in terms of accuracy, with a depth of 4 and a width of 100. However, the Arithmetic Circuit model was faster to train, with a depth of 8 and a width of 4. The Random Forest model was the slowest to train, with a depth of 5 and a width of 6.
