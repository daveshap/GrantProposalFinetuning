The /f_irst column of a class set is the pristine sample image of CIFAR- 10. The second, third and fourth columns are the images corrupted by blur, noise and JPEG compression respectively. Given the pristine images, a DNN model can correctly identify them. However, when distortions are injected, the DNN model may misclassify the inputs. The labels below thumbnails are the prediction results by the DNN model. with low quality images. In particular, we /f_irst train the deep neural network by augmenting the data with the mixture of pristine and distorted data. Then an IQA-based label smoothing technique is pro- posed to enhance the performance of deep models by /f_ine-tuning the network with the IQA measure. In this manner, the robustness of DNN models with distorted input data can be signi/f_icantly im- proved. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can signi/f_icantly improve the classi/f_ication performance of both high and low quality images. The main contributions of the paper are as follows: 1)We investigate in training deep models with data augmentation by both high and low quality images, and in-depth analyses of involving low quality images in the training process are also provided. 2)We make a further attempt to adopt the IQA measure for label smoothing in the deep neural network training process. This leads us to the robust neural network that provides promising prediction performance for images with a broad range of quality levels. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we ana- lyze the data augmentation with distorted images for deep learning. In Section 3, the proposed scheme with IQA-based label smooth- ing is introduced. Section 4 provides the experimental results and analyses. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper. 2 DATA AUGMENTATION WITH DISTORTED IMAGES FOR DEEP LEARNING It is generally acknowledged that the capability of the deep model largely depends on the training data. As such, to deal with the low quality test images, the straightforward solution is augmenting thetraining data with low quality versions and mixing them together with the original high quality data. In view of this, in this work we involve the pristine as well as the distorted images as the input data to learn the CNN model. The distorted versions are generated by injecting dierent levels of distortion into the pristine training images manually. As one of the /f_irst attempts using distorted images as the training data, here we are particularly interested in three types of commonly encountered distortions: blur, noise and JPEG compression. Blurring artifacts are introduced due to the limitations of acqui- sition process such as camera motion or out-of-focus of the optical system. In addition, necessary image processing operations may also create blurring artifacts, such as denoising and compression. Therefore, investigating the blurring artifacts enables us to simulate the real-world application scenarios in recognizing and understand- ing the blurry images. Blurring artifacts will dramatically reduce the sharpness of images and distort the structural information of the texture content, which directly in/f_luence the interpretation of the images. Noise may result from acquiring images with low quality camera sensors or in poor illumination conditions. Generally speaking, Gaussian noise can be used to model this scenario by adding the disturbance to each pixel. The introduced noise will make the image more disorderly with higher uncertainties for human perception from the perspective of the free energy theory [20]. Lossy compression techniques are also commonly used in com- puter vision processing, which introduce distortion in visual signals while reducing storage or memory footprint requirement simul- taneously. Among the digital image coding standards, JPEG com- pression is the most wildly-used one, which brings strong blocking boundaries and ringing artifacts in low bit coding scenarios.

The modules in the orange dashed box represent the training process while the modules in the green dashed box stand for the inference process. All these types of distortions may introduce disturbance in repre- senting the semantic information of images by damaging the image content. According to the study in [ 3], not only the human visual system, but also computer vision algorithms cannot eciently rec- ognize and understand the visual information with these three kinds of distortions. Therefore, it is meaningful to start from these artifacts, which pose a unique set of challenges to computer vi- sion tasks. However, there are also side eects when both pristine and distorted images are used as the training data. In particular, al- though the model can provide promising prediction performance on the distorted images in principle, it may also signi/f_icantly degrade the testing performance when we feed the high quality images as the input. Thus, in this work we further seek a good balance between the high quality and low quality training images with IQA to learn a more robust model. 3 IQA-BASED LABEL SMOOTHING In typical image classi/f_ication tasks, a softmax layer is usually laid on the top of a neural network to predict the probabilities of an input image belonging to each given class. Alternatively, the probability can also be treated as the perceptive con/f_idence of the model for the input image belonging to a speci/f_ic class. For


LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

This paper investigates the use of distorted images for training deep neural networks, with the goal of improving the classification performance of low quality images. The authors first train the network with a mix of pristine and distorted data, then use an IQA-based label smoothing technique to fine-tune the network. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the classification performance of both high and low quality images.
