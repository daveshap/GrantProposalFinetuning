Summarize the following paper for literature review.


PAPER:
in order to ex- cite a given number of neighbors would actually have to have information on the number and state (active, refrac- tory or silent) of the post-synaptic neurons and also for other presynaptic neurons attempting to excite the same neuron. This is biologically highly unrealistic, because the neurons involved may be centimeters away from each other, without direct connection among them. Moreover, such hypothetically very well informed Jneuron will have to selectively cancel its stimulation strength with certain Ineurons, as dictated by the value of p, a requirement completely impossible for biological neurons. Of course, the discussion above is not a ecting the valuable points made in ref. [15] where the KC model was introduced to show that a network of identical excitable elements achieves maximum dynamic range at criticality. Since the simulations in Ref. [15] where made on  xed topology networks (Erd os-Renyi) the present results are not a ecting any of its conclusions which, is worth notic- ing, were replicated in many other models as well as in ex- periments. Less clear are the results in other cases, when the KC model was used to study the dynamics of non ran- dom topologies. These include the deviations from mean  eld behavior found in scale free networks, as reported by Copelli & Campos [38] or Mosqueiro & Maia [39]. We note in passing that there are multiple instances in which the KC model was (mis)named as \Greenberg & Hast- ings stochastic model", somewhat confusing according to the present results, as in the reports by Copelli & Cam- pos [38], Wu et al. , [40], Asis & Copelli [41], Mosqueiro 8 & Maia [39], to name only a few. It is worth to note that the crucial in uence of topology on the type of dynamics exhibited by excitable models has been discussed earlier by Kuperman & Abramson [42] in the context of epidemics. They found that the network degree and disorder determines the conditions at which endemic or epidemic situations occur. To conclude, the point here is not that one needs super- realistic microscopic rules to build a valid model, but that microscopic rules do matter, and may lead to di erent collective behavior. In particular, we have shown that the KC model exhibits only one type of transition, inde- pendent of a large variation in the network topology. The observation that topology has in uence on the dynamics of certain models is fundamental at the present time, where several large scale international scienti c collabo-rations are devoted to map and study the consequences of features of the human brain connectome [43{45]. Ex- amples include the numerical simulations using simpli ed models over derived connectomes, in order to understand brain functioning [10]. However, not all neural models are the same , and special care should be taken on the biases and limitations introduced by the applied models, before drawing conclusions on real brains. V.

LITERATURE REVIEW SUMMARY:

==========

The paper discusses the use of the KC model to study the dynamics of excitable systems. The authors argue that the model is not realistic enough to be used to study real-world systems, as it does not take into account the number and state of post-synaptic neurons. They also argue that the model is not suitable for studying the dynamics of non-random topologies, as it does not accurately capture the behavior of real-world systems.
