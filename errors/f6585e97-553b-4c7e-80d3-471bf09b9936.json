Recent X-ray masses reported by independent groups show\\naverage differences smaller than $\\\\sim$10$\\\\%$, posing a strong limit on the\\nsystematics that can be ascribed to the differences in the X-ray analysis when\\nstudying the hydrostatic bias. The mean ratio between our X-ray masses and the\\nweak-lensing masses in the LC$^2$-single catalog is 1-$b$=0.74$\\\\pm$0.06.\\nHowever, the mean mass ratios inferred from the WL masses of different projects\\nvary by a large amount, with APEX-SZ showing a bias consistent with zero\\n(1-$b$=1.02$\\\\pm$0.12), LoCuSS and CCCP/MENeaCS showing a significant difference\\n(1-$b$=0.76$\\\\pm$0.09 and 1-$b$=0.77$\\\\pm$0.10, respectively), and WtG pointing\\nto the largest deviation (1-$b$=0.61$\\\\pm$0.12). At odds with the WL results,\\nthe dynamical mass measurements show better agreement with the X-ray\\nhydrostatic masses, although there are significant differences when relaxed or\\ndisturbed clusters are used. The different ratios obtained using different mass\\nestimators suggest that there are still systematics that are not accounted for\\nin all the techniques used to recover cluster masses. This prevents the\\ndetermination of firm constraints on the level of hydrostatic mass bias in\\ngalaxy clusters.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 18:00:09 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2021-01-04\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Lovisari\",\"L.\",\"\"],[\"Ettori\",\"S.\",\"\"],[\"Sereno\",\"M.\",\"\"],[\"Schellenberger\",\"G.\",\"\"],[\"Forman\",\"W.

Unfortunately, as we show,\\nexisting gradual type systems such as TypeScript and Flow are unsound in the\\npresence of method extraction.

IRS\\n63, a single Class I source located in the nearby Ophiuchus molecular cloud (at\\na distance of 144 pc), is one of the brightest Class I protostars at\\n(sub)millimeter wavelengths that also has a relatively large disk (>50 au).\\nMultiple annular substructures observed towards disks at young times can act as\\nan early foothold for dust grain growth, a prerequisite of planet formation.\\nWhether planets already exist or not in the disk of IRS 63, it is clear that\\nthe planet formation process begins in the young protostellar phases, earlier\\nthan predicted by current planet formation theories.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 21:18:20 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Segura-Cox\",\"Dominique M.\",\"\"],[\"Schmiedeke\",\"Anika\",\"\"],[\"Pineda\",\"Jaime E.\",\"\"],[\"Stephens\",\"Ian W.\",\"\"],[\"Fern\\u00e1ndez-L\\u00f3pez\",\"Manuel\",\"\"],[\"Looney\",\"Leslie W.\",\"\"],[\"Caselli\",\"Paola\",\"\"],[\"Li\",\"Zhi-Yun\",\"\"],[\"Mundy\",\"Lee G.\",\"\"],[\"Kwon\",\"Woojin\",\"\"],[\"Harris\",\"Robert J.\",\"\"]]}",

COHORT is a practical,\\nscalable, and versatile solution that coordinates a population of TCLs to\\njointly optimize a grid-level objective, while satisfying each TCL's end-use\\nrequirements and operational constraints.

After coordination, each TCL is responsible for\\nits own control and tracks the agreed-upon power trajectory with its preferred\\nstrategy. In this work, we translate continuous power back to discrete on/off\\nactuation, using pulse width modulation.

In this paper, we present empirical results\\nshowing that the performance of a cascaded pipeline that separately identifies\\nimportant content pieces and stitches them together into a coherent text is\\ncomparable to or outranks that of end-to-end systems, whereas a pipeline\\narchitecture allows for flexible content selection. We finally discuss how we\\ncan take advantage of a cascaded pipeline in neural text summarization and shed\\nlight on important directions for future research.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 01:49:16 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Lebanoff\",\"Logan\",\"\"],[\"Dernoncourt\",\"Franck\",\"\"],[\"Kim\",\"Doo Soon\",\"\"],[\"Chang\",\"Walter\",\"\"],[\"Liu\",\"Fei\",\"\"]]}",

Our proposed unsupervised approach learns a\\nmemory component to summarize system utterances into a short span of words. To\\nfurther promote a compact action representation, we propose an auxiliary task\\nthat restores state annotations as the summarized dialogue context using the\\nmemory component. Our proposed approach outperforms latent action baselines on\\nMultiWOZ, a benchmark multi-domain dataset.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 04:37:22 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Huang\",\"Xinting\",\"\"],[\"Qi\",\"Jianzhong\",\"\"],[\"Sun\",\"Yu\",\"\"],[\"Zhang\",\"Rui\",\"\"]]}",

This\\nphenomenon is phased-matched through the relative phase detuning between the\\nintracavity fields associated with the two principal polarization modes of the\\ncavity. Our experimental investigation is based on a 12-m long fiber ring\\nresonator in which a polarization controller is inserted to finely control the\\nlevel of intra-cavity birefringence. Depending on the amount of birefringence,\\nthe temporal patterns generated via PMI are found to be either stationary or to\\nexhibit a period-doubled dynamics. Experimental results are in good agreement\\nwith numerical simulations based on an Ikeda map for the two orthogonally\\npolarized modes. Our study provides new insights into the control of modulation\\ninstability in multimode Kerr resonators. Modulation instability (MI) is a\\nnonlinear phenomenon characterized by the exponential growth and evolution of\\nperiodic perturbations on top of an intense continuous-wave (cw) laser beam [1,\\n2]. Underpinned by a nonlinearly phase-matched parametric process, it is\\nassociated with a transfer of energy from a narrow pump frequency component to\\na pair of sidebands arranged symmetrically around the pump. In single-pass\\noptical fiber propagation, MI can be naturally phase-matched through a balance\\nbetween anomalous group-velocity dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity [1, 2]. In\\ncontrast, more general phase-matching conditions are possible in the context of\\npassive Kerr resonators, such as fiber ring cavities, because of the crucial\\nrole played by the systems' boundary conditions [3-5]. Various configurations\\nof MI have been investigated in that context, including MI in the normal\\ndispersion regime, MI via bichromatic or incoherent driving, as well as\\ncompetition between MI and Faraday or period-doubled (P2) instabilities\\n[6--12]. Moreover, at variance with single-pass propagation, MI in Kerr\\nresonators can lead to the emergence of stationary periodic (Turing) patterns;\\nsuch patterns are now understood to be intimately related to temporal cavity\\nsolitons and microresonator optical frequency combs [13--16]. Birefringence,\\nand nonlinear coupling between the polarization components of light, is also\\nknown to contribute to the phase-matching of parametric processes. This leads\\nto polarization MI (PMI) and the emergence of vector temporal patterns [17-19].\\nIn driven resonators, PMI has only been investigated theoretically so far\\n[20-22], but recent demonstrations of orthogonally-polarized dual comb\\ngeneration in microresonators are sparking a renewed interest in this process\\n[23]. In this Letter, we report on the direct experimental observation of PMI\\nin a passive Kerr resonator. Our experimental test-bed is based on a normally\\ndispersive fiber ring cavity that incorporates a polarization controller for\\nadjustment of the intra-cavity birefringence. This localized birefringence\\ngives rise to a relative phase detuning between the two orthogonal polarization\\nmodes of the cavity, which in turn affects the frequency shift of the PMI\\nsidebands. We also find that birefringence can lead to period-doubled (P2)\\ndynamics, characterized by a two round-trip cycle. Our experimental results are\\nin good agreement with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations based\\non an iterative two-component Ikeda map. The experimental setup is displayed in\\nFig. 1(a). It consists of a L = 12-m long passive fiber ring cavity with a\\nfinesse F of about 27, mainly built out of spun fiber. To avoid competition\\nwith scalar MI [2], we have built a cavity with normal group-velocity\\ndispersion estimated to 2 = 47 ps 2 /km, a value large enough to neglect\\nthird-order dispersion. Also, the use of a spun fiber (nearly isotropic) avoids\\ngroup-velocity mismatch between the polarization components. Additionally, to\\nprevent any additional source of bending-induced birefringence, the fiber was\\ncarefully off-spooled and wound directly on our experimental board with a large\\n50-cm diameter. We estimate that this causes a birefringence $\\\\Delta$n no\\ngreater than 10 --8 [24], which can be neglected in our study.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 07:47:11 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Fatome\",\"Julien\",\"\",\"LICB\"],[\"Kibler\",\"Bertrand\",\"\"],[\"Leo\",\"Fran\\u00e7ois\",\"\"],[\"Bendahmane\",\"Abdelkrim\",\"\"],[\"Oppo\",\"Gian-Luca\",\"\"],[\"Garbin\",\"Bruno\",\"\"],[\"Murdoch\",\"Stuart\",\"\"],[\"Erkintalo\",\"Miro\",\"\"],[\"Coen\",\"St\\u00e9phane\",\"\"]]}",

In this paper, we first propose a quasi-monolithic\\nformulation with exact interface tracking to simulate the fluid-multilayered\\nstructure interactions.

We then use this\\nformulation to study a two-layered flexible plate, wherein each layer of the\\nplate has independent material properties. Systematic parametric simulations\\nare conducted to understand the effect of difference in material properties\\nbetween the two layers of a plate on the self-sustained flapping dynamics. The\\nparametric simulations are performed at a Reynolds number Re=1000 by selecting\\ndifferent values of Young's modulus and density for each of the layers such\\nthat the average structure to fluid mass ratio (m)avg=0.1 and average\\nnon-dimensional bending stiffness (KB)avg=0.0005.

Following\\nthis, the effect of such difference in elastic properties on the onset of\\nflapping is investigated for a case with Re=1000, (m)avg=0.1 and (KB)avg=0.0008\\nand two distinct response regimes are observed: (a) fixed-point stable and (b)\\nperiodic LCO.

The second one is an improvement of\\nthe first and employs bubble representations of proper interval graph to\\nrealize an improved complexity of ${\\\\cal O}(n+ \\\\vert{\\\\cal B}\\\\vert \\\\cdot \\\\log\\nk)$ for a graph represented by $\\\\vert{\\\\cal B}\\\\vert$ bubbles.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 09:40:35 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Ekim\",\"T\\u0131naz\",\"\"],[\"Farley\",\"Arthur\",\"\"],[\"Proskurowski\",\"Andrzej\",\"\"],[\"Shalom\",\"Mordechai\",\"\"]]}",

This is a continuation of the work presented in [2] in\\nwhich Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of co-current turbulent Taylor bubble flow\\nwas presented. It was observed that one of the main challenges is the\\nphysically accurate prediction of the behavior of the Taylor bubble skirt, and\\nthe related bubble shedding. An underestimation of the turbulent fluctuations\\nin the wake of the Taylor bubble was observed in the LES results. It was\\nsuggested that this is related to over-prediction of the loss of void of the\\nTaylor bubble due to bubble shedding induced by an LES mesh resolution which is\\nnot sufficient to capture the break-up and bubble formation accurately. To\\ncounter this, in the current work we present a DNS approach of co-current\\nturbulent Taylor bubble flow called RK-Basilisk, based on the Basilisk code\\nwith local adaptive grid refinement. This strategy allows for very high mesh\\nresolution near the bubble's interface while elsewhere the grid is allowed to\\nbe coarser. Each time step, the mesh is adapted based on a void fraction\\ncriterion. Basilisk's underlying data structure which is based on an 'octree'\\nallows for much faster solution procedures and, therefore, a much greater\\nnumber of grid points as compared to the LES simulations which were performed\\nusing the more general OpenFOAM code. We compare the results against\\nexperimental data of the same setting, as well as the co-current LES OpenFOAM\\nresults. The setting of turbulent Taylor bubble flow in co-current conditions\\nallows for both lower order turbulence model development and the validation of\\nmore general two-phase modeling strategies. Taylor bubble flow in itself also\\nbears relevance to specific two-phase flow situations. The current work\\ncontributes to an advancement in simulation capability for such situations.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 09:43:23 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-10-09\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Frederix\",\"Edo M.

However, even with state-of-the-art computational algorithms the method\\nis limited due to the inherently ill-posed and rank-deficient tomographic data\\ninversion, and by high computational cost. These issues hinder its application\\nfor real-time flow diagnosis. To address them, we present here a novel\\nCST-based convolutional neural Network (CSTNet) for high-fidelity, rapid, and\\nsimultaneous imaging of species concentration and temperature. CSTNet\\nintroduces a shared feature extractor that incorporates the CST measurement and\\nsensor layout into the learning network. In addition, a dual-branch\\narchitecture is proposed for image reconstruction with crosstalk decoders that\\nautomatically learn the naturally correlated distributions of species\\nconcentration and temperature. The proposed CSTNet is validated both with\\nsimulated datasets, and with measured data from real flames in experiments\\nusing an industry-oriented sensor. Superior performance is found relative to\\nprevious approaches, in terms of robustness to measurement noise and\\nmillisecond-level computing time. This is the first time, to the best of our\\nknowledge, that a deep learning-based algorithm for CST has been experimentally\\nvalidated for simultaneous imaging of multiple critical parameters in reactive\\nflows using a low-complexity optical sensor with severely limited number of\\nlaser beams.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 09:49:49 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v2\",\"created\":\"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 19:38:53 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v3\",\"created\":\"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 19:58:31 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2021-04-06\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Jiang\",\"Yunfan\",\"\"],[\"Si\",\"Jingjing\",\"\"],[\"Zhang\",\"Rui\",\"\"],[\"Enemali\",\"Godwin\",\"\"],[\"Zhou\",\"Bin\",\"\"],[\"McCann\",\"Hugh\",\"\"],[\"Liu\",\"Chang\",\"\"]]}",
