In the first one, we will show the birth\\nof this theory as an adaptation of homodyne and heterodyne classical detection\\nto Quantum Mechanics. In the second, we will describe a tomographic description\\nof Quantum Mechanics on C*-algebras by splitting the theory in two parts: a\\nGeneralized Sampling Theory and a Generalized Positive Transform. In the third,\\nwe will present the first numerical algorithm that solves the Clebsh-Gordan\\ndecomposition problem for any finite-dimensional unitary representation of any\\nfinite or compact Lie group. This algorithm receives the name of SMILY\\nalgorithm. In the fourth and fifth chapters, we will discuss tomography of\\nsystems parametrized with fields. In the fourth, we will reconstruct states of\\nclassical systems and in the fifth, we will do the same with quantum ones, but\\nhere in two different ways: the first one will be done by adapting the\\nreconstruction formula of chapter four, and the second one by means of the\\naxiomatic description of Wightamn-Streater of a Quantum Field Theory.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 17:24:54 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2015-12-29\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"L\\u00f3pez-Yela\",\"Alberto\",\"\"]]}",

To address this challenge, we introduce a new\\natoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one\\nelectron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned\\nto the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set\\ntype because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the\\nassigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging\\npolyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling\\nscale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good\\ntransferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7)\\nthe assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin\\nmoments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a\\nunique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales\\nlinearly with increasing system size.

This solution exhibits a res- onance if the libration\\nfrequency matches the frequency of the spin-over inertial mode. Furthermore, we\\nextend our model by introducing a reduced model of the effect of viscous Ekman\\nlayers in the limit of low Ekman number (Noir and C\\\\'ebron 2013). This\\ntheoretical approach is consistent with the results of Chan et al. (2011) and\\nZhang et al. (2012) for spheroidal geometries. Our results are validated\\nagainst systematic three-dimensional numerical simulations. In the second part\\nof the paper, we present the first linear sta- bility analysis of this uniform\\nvorticity flow. To this end, we adopt different methods (Lifschitz and Hameiri\\n1991; Gledzer and Ponomarev 1977) that allow to deduce upper and lower bounds\\nfor the growth rate of an instability. Our analysis shows that the uniform\\nvorticity base flow is prone to inertial instabilities caused by a parametric\\nresonance mechanism. This is confirmed by a set of direct numerical\\nsimulations. Applying our results to planetary settings, we find that neither a\\nspin-over resonance nor an inertial instability can exist within the liquid\\ncore of the Moon, Io and Mercury.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 21:47:28 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v2\",\"created\":\"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 10:00:25 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2016-01-11\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Vantieghem\",\"S.\",\"\"],[\"C\\u00e9bron\",\"D.\",\"\"],[\"Noir\",\"J.\",\"\"]]}",

Tikhonov regularization, or ridge regression, is a popular approach\\nto address this issue. We reveal here a formal analogy between ridge regression\\nand statistical mechanics, where the objective function is comparable to a free\\nenergy and the ridge parameter plays the role of temperature. This analogy\\nsuggests two new criteria to select a suitable ridge parameter: the\\nspecific-heat (Cv) and the maximum penalty (MP) fits. We apply these methods to\\nthe calibration of the force constant in elastic network models (ENM). This key\\nparameter determines the amplitude of the predicted atomic fluctuations, and is\\ncommonly obtained by fitting crystallographic B-factors. However, rigid-body\\nmotions are often partially neglected in such fits, even though their\\nimportance has been repeatedly stressed. Considering the full set of rigid-body\\nand internal degrees of freedom bears significant risks of overfitting, due to\\nstrong correlations between explanatory variables, and requires thus careful\\nregularization. Using simulated data, we show that ridge regression with the Cv\\nor MP criterion markedly reduces the error of the estimated force constant, its\\nacross-protein variation, and the number of proteins with unphysical values of\\nthe fit parameters, in comparison with popular regularization schemes such as\\ngeneralized cross-validation. When applied to protein crystals, the new methods\\nprovide a more robust calibration of ENM force constants, even though\\nrigid-body motions account on average for more than 80% of the amplitude of\\nB-factors. While MP emerges as the optimal choice for fitting crystallographic\\nB-factors, the Cv fit is more robust to the nature of the data, and is thus an\\ninteresting candidate for other applications.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 00:16:53 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2015-12-29\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Bastolla\",\"Ugo\",\"\"],[\"Dehouck\",\"Yves\",\"\"]]}",

We establish explicit bijections between these objects and families of\\ninteger arrays with certain nonzero entries, which also proves the second\\nformula.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 08:53:22 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v2\",\"created\":\"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 15:28:12 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v3\",\"created\":\"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 13:59:42 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v4\",\"created\":\"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 13:55:16 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v5\",\"created\":\"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 01:57:26 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2019-06-26\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Morales\",\"Alejandro\",\"\"],[\"Pak\",\"Igor\",\"\"],[\"Panova\",\"Greta\",\"\"]]}",

The performance of the proposed approach is validated by\\nmeasuring its impact on response time and throughput, and comparing the\\nperformance to that of other techniques in the literature.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 12:11:36 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2015-12-29\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Hababeh\",\"Ismail\",\"\"]]}",

At the same time, fire plays a vital role in restoring\\necological balance in many ecosystems. Fuel management, or treatment planning\\nby way of planned burning, is an important tool used in many countries where\\nfire is a major ecosystem process. In this paper, we propose an approach to\\nreduce the spatial connectivity of fuel hazards while still considering the\\necological fire requirements of the ecosystem. A mixed integer programming\\n(MIP) model is formulated in such a way that it breaks the connectivity of\\nhigh-risk regions as a means to reduce fuel hazards in the landscape. This\\nmulti-period model tracks the age of each vegetation type and determines the\\noptimal time and locations to conduct fuel treatments. The minimum and maximum\\nTolerable Fire Intervals (TFI), which define the ages at which certain\\nvegetation type can be treated for ecological reasons, are taken into account\\nby the model. Previous work has been limited to using single vegetation types\\nimplemented within rectangular grids. In this paper, we significantly extend\\nprevious work by modelling multiple vegetation types implemented within a\\npolygon-based network. Thereby a more realistic representation of the landscape\\nis achieved. An analysis of the proposed approach was conducted for a fuel\\ntreatment area comprising 711 treatment units in the Barwon-Otway district of\\nVictoria, Australia. The solution of the proposed model can be obtained for\\n20-year fuel treatment planning within a reasonable computation time of eight\\nhours.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 06:47:59 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2015-12-29\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Rachmawati\",\"Ramya\",\"\"],[\"Ozlen\",\"Melih\",\"\"],[\"Reinke\",\"Karin J.\",\"\"],[\"Hearne\",\"John W.\",\"\"]]}",

These\\nfindings imply unfolding in these single domain proteins involves a switch in\\nthe pathway as $f$ or $[C]$ is increased from a low to a high value. We provide\\na unified theory demonstrating that if $\\\\log k_\\\\mathrm{u}$ as a function of a\\nperturbation ($f$ or $[C]$) exhibits upward curvature then the underlying\\nenergy landscape must be strongly multidimensional. Using molecular simulations\\nwe provide a structural basis for the switch in the pathways and dramatic\\nshifts in the transition state ensemble (TSE) in src SH3 domain as $f$ is\\nincreased. We show that a single point mutation shifts the upward curvature in\\n$\\\\log k_\\\\mathrm{u}(f)$ to a lower force, thus establishing the malleability of\\nthe underlying folding landscape. Our theory, applicable to any perturbation\\nthat affects the free energy of the protein linearly, readily explains movement\\nin the TSE in a $\\\\beta$-sandwich (I27) protein and single chain monellin as the\\ndenaturant concentration is varied. We predict that in the force range\\naccessible in laser optical tweezer experiments there should be a switch in the\\nunfolding pathways in I27 or its mutants.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 17:57:00 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2016-04-27\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Zhuravlev\",\"Pavel I.\",\"\"],[\"Hinczewski\",\"Michael\",\"\"],[\"Chakrabarti\",\"Shaon\",\"\"],[\"Marqusee\",\"Susan\",\"\"],[\"Thirumalai\",\"D.\",\"\"]]}",

Being a paper scientist the author\\nrefers to the sheet of paper which is a stochastic fibrous set whose porous\\ntexture can be considered as an archetype for many natural or artificial human\\nstructures. The paper properties are correlated with its texture by taking\\naccount the effect of chance occurring during its manufacturing process. The\\ntheoretical developments, the formalism and the application methods presented\\nin this study have a general significance beyond the only paper material.A\\nspecific property of sets of objects randomly unorderly distributed in space is\\ntheir interfaces orientation distribution. This distribution is usually\\nobtained by the analysis of images sampled in the object sets. The density of\\norientation probability of the fibers or of the texture interfaces, weighted by\\ntheir length or by their area, can be interpreted as the radius of curvature of\\nan outline or of a warped surface which characterizes, from a global and\\nstatistical point of view, the texture geometry in two or three dimensions.\\nThis figure named by the author the \\\"equivalent pore\\\", is with its elliptical\\nshape similar to the one of the mean pore defined by the mean directional chord\\nbetween the interfaces in the texture. Different methods of \\\"equivalent pore\\\"\\nestablishing are analyzed : by conformal map of the fiber network or of the\\ntexture interfaces, by images stereometric analysis of texture tomographical\\ncuts, by scattering and diffraction of a laser light beam impacting the fibrous\\ntexture or the material surface replica, by hard X-ray absorption and phase\\ncontrast at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities(ESRF), in Grenoble.\\nThe \\\"equivalent pore\\\" concept allows us to study random unordered sets behavior\\nin strength fields while simplifying this analysis. Thus a phenomenon occurring\\nin a plane set, in two dimensions, can be analyzed on its \\\"equivalent pore\\\"\\nlinear outline, and a phenomenon which occurs in volume in a three dimensional\\nset can be analyzed on its \\\"equivalent pore\\\" warped surface. This concept has\\nbeen applied for physical, mechanical, optical and ionic conduction properties\\nof materials like papers, boards, felts, nonwoven textiles, polymer foams,\\nmetallic alloys with grain joints, geological grounds, and for the surface\\nmapping of natural relief and of materials with different gloss, worn or\\nroughness levels.The ellipse and the ellipso\\\\\\\"id, as well as multi-modes\\ncompositions of it, are the most appropriate figures to represent the\\n\\\"equivalent pore\\\" of materials with a random unordered texture. The fact that a\\nlaw, which defines the curvature of an elliptic deterministic geometrical\\nconfiguration, is essential to represent interface orientation allocation of\\nelements whose spatial distribution is probabilistic is a noteworthy fact that\\nmakes us wonder. This assertion is corroborated by fluid flow analysis through\\nporous media. The global dissipated energy for fluid flow is distributed along\\nthe motion (translation and rotation) and fluid deformation components on the\\n\\\"equivalent pore\\\" whose surface is conformal to the texture interfaces\\ntangential space. The porous media being homogenous and the fluid particles\\nindistinguishable each ones from the others, due to permanent stochastic\\nexchanges from one fluid volume element into another, we conclude that their\\nmotion quantification is invariant on each point of the \\\"equivalent pore\\\"\\nsurface. This quantification can be represented by a group of elliptical\\ncylinders.The \\\"equivalent pore\\\" and cylinders group surface intersections\\ndefine the fluid particle probabilistic paths in the porous media. One singular\\ngeometrical configuration of the elliptic cylinders group union with the\\nellipsoidal \\\"equivalent pore\\\" fulfills the minimal energy dissipation\\nrequirements in the stress field applied to the fluid. The resulting paths are\\nellipso\\\\\\\"ido-cylindrical curves carpeting the ellipso\\\\\\\"id by a beam of\\nisoperim\\\\'etric lacets, in close or open loops depending on the possible\\npairing off the curves in their nodals and isoclinal tangency points. The flow\\nlaminarity and unrotationality are globally established in the porous media at\\nthe macroscopic scale, for Reynold's number small values, in agreement with the\\nresults found moreover. The so defined ellipso\\\\\\\"ido-cylindrical curve is a\\nstationary curve at the average least action meaning, for a punctual mobile or\\na deformable volume element moving on the surface of the ellipsoid from a nodal\\nspot to the other in an antipodal position. This curve establishes a gauge\\nwhich characterizes, from a global point of view, the physical space embraced\\nby the fluid during its flow, in dynamical balance conditions compatible with\\nthe stress field. The ellipso\\\\\\\"ido-cylindrical curve allows to carpet the\\nellipso\\\\\\\"id as a function of one cyclic angular variable, which is a new\\nconstruction for the ellipso\\\\\\\"id. When the set of the objects is isotropic the\\ncurve is sphero-cylindrical whose plan mapping permit to decipher the tai-chi\\nfigure of the Tao\\\\\\\"ist Buddhism philosophy.This study of random unordered\\nobject sets, and more specially of fibrous porous media, allows to establish a\\nstructural link between their small scale texture stochastic disorder and the\\nharmonious order that emerges from these sets at a larger scale. The largest\\nchance possible, compatible with the stress field which put a strain on these\\nsets, is the necessary and sufficient variable which allows to best globally\\nadjust their behaviors according to the probabilistic and deterministic laws\\ngoverning their evolution.The vocabulary used in this study is issued from the\\ncommon language, most of the time adapted to the material class, it is\\ntransposable in other fields of interest.

At fixed stellar mass, the NFW scale parameter, r_s, for the\\nsatellite distribution of red hosts exceeds r_s for the satellite distribution\\nof blue hosts. In both cases the dependence of r_s on host stellar mass is\\nwell-fitted by a power law. For the satellites of red hosts, r_s^{red} \\\\propto\\n(M_\\\\ast / M_\\\\sun)^{0.71 \\\\pm 0.05} while for the satellites of blue hosts,\\nr_s^{blue} \\\\propto (M_\\\\ast / M_\\\\sun)^{0.48 \\\\pm 0.07}$. For hosts with stellar\\nmasses greater than 4.0E+10 M_sun, the satellite distribution around blue hosts\\nis more concentrated than is the satellite distribution around red hosts. The\\nspatial distribution of the satellites of red hosts traces that of the hosts'\\nhalos; however, the spatial distribution of the satellites of blue hosts is\\nmore concentrated than that of the hosts' halos by a factor of ~2. Our\\nmethodology is general and applies to any analysis of satellites in a mock\\nredshift survey. However, our conclusions necessarily depend upon the\\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation model that was adopted, and different galaxy\\nformation models may yield different results.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 21:00:08 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v2\",\"created\":\"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:59:58 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2018-06-21\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Agustsson\",\"Ingolfur\",\"\"],[\"Brainerd\",\"Tereasa G.\",\"\"]]}",

The Bayesian Network, which is one of the most common PGMs\\nused in machine learning and data mining, demonstrates this limitation when the\\ntraining data consists of random variables, each of them has a large set of\\npossible values. In the big data era, one would expect new extensions to the\\nexisting PGMs to handle the massive amount of data produced these days by\\ncomputers, sensors and other electronic devices.
