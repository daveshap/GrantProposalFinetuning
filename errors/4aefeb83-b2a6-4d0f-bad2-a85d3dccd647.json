The extension was made possible by the fact that all Hill numbers are in\\nunits of species (referred to as the effective number of species or as species\\nequivalents), and I postulated that Hill numbers should follow the same or\\nsimilar pattern of SAR.

Upon\\ncollisions with the circumburst matter, the fireball of a GRB starts to\\ndecelerate, producing a peak or a break (depending on the circumburst density\\nprofile) in the light curve of the afterglow. Considering all bursts with known\\nredshift and with an early coverage of their emission, we find 67 GRBs with a\\npeak in their optical or GeV light curves at a time $t_{\\\\rm p}$. For another\\n106 GRBs we set an upper limit $t_{\\\\rm p}^{\\\\rm UL}$. We show that $t_{\\\\rm p}$\\nis due to the dynamics of the fireball deceleration and not to the passage of a\\ncharacteristic frequency of the synchrotron spectrum across the optical band.\\nConsidering the $t_{\\\\rm p}$ of 66 long GRBs and the 85 most constraining upper\\nlimits, using censored data analysis methods, we reconstruct the most likely\\ndistribution of $t_{\\\\rm p}$. All $t_{\\\\rm p}$ are larger than the time $t_{\\\\rm\\np,g}$ when the prompt emission peaks, and are much larger than the time $t_{\\\\rm\\nph}$ when the fireball becomes transparent. The reconstructed distribution of\\n$\\\\Gamma_0$ has median value $\\\\sim$300 (150) for a uniform (wind) circumburst\\ndensity profile. In the comoving frame, long GRBs have typical isotropic\\nenergy, luminosity, and peak energy $\\\\langle E_{\\\\rm iso}\\\\rangle=3(8)\\\\times\\n10^{50}$ erg, $\\\\langle L_{\\\\rm iso}\\\\rangle=3(15) \\\\times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ,\\nand $\\\\langle E_{\\\\rm peak}\\\\rangle =1(2)$ keV in the homogeneous (wind) case.

As accurate modelling of the sources of variability is a\\ncornerstone to intelligent decision making, we investigate the consequences of\\nthe assumption of independent and identically distributed variables that is\\noften made when modelling sources of variability such as down-times, arrivals,\\nor process-times. We first explain the experiment setting that allows, through\\nsimulations and statistical tests, to measure the variability potential stored\\nin a specific sequence of data. We show from industrial data that dependent\\nbehaviors might actually be the rule with potentially considerable consequences\\nin terms of cycle time. As complex industries require strong levers to allow\\ntheir tractability, this work underlines the need for a richer and more\\naccurate modelling of real systems. Keywords-variability; cycle time; dependent\\nevents; simulation; complex manufacturing; industry 4.0 I. Accurate modelling\\nof variability and the independence assumption Industry 4.0 is said to be the\\nnext industrial revolution. The proper use of real-time information in complex\\nmanufacturing systems is expected to allow more customization of products in\\nhighly flexible production factories. Semiconductor High Mix Low Volume (HMLV)\\nmanufacturing facilities (called fabs) are one example of candidates for this\\ntransition towards \\\"smart industries\\\". However, because of the high levels of\\nvariability, the environment of a HMLV fab is highly stochastic and difficult\\nto manage. The uncontrolled variability limits the predictability of the system\\nand thus the ability to meet delivery requirements in terms of volumes, cycle\\ntimes and due dates. Typically, the HMLV STMicroelectronics Crolles 300 fab\\nregularly experiences significant mix changes that result in unanticipated\\nbottlenecks, leading to firefighting to meet commitment to customers. The\\noverarching goal of our strategy is to improve the forecasting of future\\noccurrences of bottlenecks and cycle time issues in order to anticipate them\\nthrough allocation of the correct attention and resources. Our current finite\\ncapacity projection engine can effectively forecast bottlenecks, but it does\\nnot include reliable cycle time estimates. In order to enhance our projections,\\nbetter forecast cycle time losses (queuing times), improve the tractability of\\nour system and reduce our cycle times, we now need accurate dynamic cycle time\\npredictions. As increased cycle-time is the main reason workflow variability is\\nstudied (both by the scientific community and practitioners, see e.g. [1] and\\n[2]), what follows concentrates on cycle times. Moreover, the \\\"variability\\\" we\\naccount for should be understood as the potential to create higher cycle times,\\neven though \\\"variability\\\" may be understood in a broader meaning. This choice\\nis made for the sake of clarity, but the methodology we propose and the\\ndiscussion we lead can be applied to any other measurable indicator. Sources of\\nvariability have been intensely investigated in both the literature and the\\nindustry, and tool down-times, arrivals variability as well as process-time\\nvariability are recognized as the major sources of variability in that sense\\nthat they create higher cycle times (see [3] for a review and discussion). As a\\nconsequence, these factors are widely integrated into queuing formulas and\\nsimulation models with the objective to better model the complex reality of\\nmanufacturing facilities. One commonly accepted assumption in the development\\nof these models is that the variables (MTBF, MTTR, processing times, time\\nbetween arrivals, etc.) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\\nrandom variables. However, these assumptions might be the reason for models\\ninaccuracies as [4] points out in a literature review on queuing theory.\\nSeveral authors have studied the potential effects of dependencies, such as [5]\\nwho studied the potential effects of dependencies between arrivals and\\nprocess-times or [6] who investigated dependent process times, [4] also gives\\nfurther references for studies on dependencies effects.

We confirm the extreme nature of\\n5 objects also in the synchrotron emission. We do not find evidence of\\nadditional emission components in the hard X-ray band. We find that a one-zone\\nSSC model can in principle reproduce the extreme properties of both peaks in\\nthe SED, from X-ray up to TeV energies, but at the cost of i) extreme electron\\nenergies with very low radiative efficiency, ii) conditions heavily out of\\nequipartition (by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude), and iii) not accounting for the\\nsimultaneous UV data, which then should belong to a different emission\\ncomponent, possibly the same as the far-IR (WISE) data. We find evidence of\\nthis separation of the UV and X-ray emission in at least two objects.

As from our normal human experience, words expressed\\nwith different emotions or mood can have completely different meanings attached\\nto it. Lending computers the ability of classifying these facial expressions,\\ncan help add another level of deep understanding of what the deaf person\\nexactly wants to communicate. The proposed idea is implemented through a deep\\nneural network having a customized architecture. This helps learning specific\\npatterns in individual expressions much better as compared to a generic\\napproach. With an overall accuracy of 98.04%, the implemented deep network\\nperforms excellently well and thus is fit to be used in any given practical\\nscenario.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:50:46 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2017-11-20\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Walawalkar\",\"Devesh\",\"\"]]}",

We evaluate our approach by modeling the types of open-ended questions\\ngenerated by humans who were attempting to learn about an ambiguous situation\\nin a game. We find that our model predicts what questions people will ask, and\\ncan creatively produce novel questions that were not present in the training\\nset. In addition, we compare a number of model variants, finding that both\\nquestion informativeness and complexity are important for producing human-like\\nquestions.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 23:27:04 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2017-11-20\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Rothe\",\"Anselm\",\"\"],[\"Lake\",\"Brenden M.\",\"\"],[\"Gureckis\",\"Todd M.\",\"\"]]}",

The optimal solutions to such tasks are\\nheavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the\\nconfiguration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches,\\nhowever, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort\\nsearching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In\\nthis paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search\\nstrategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the\\ninformation uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a\\nproblem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given\\niteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning\\naction. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial information based\\npolicies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key\\ninsight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would\\neasily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a\\nnovel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning\\npolicies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that at train time has\\nfull knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We\\nleverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently\\ncomputed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy.

Cold dust emission from the\\nIRDC is detected at seven wavelength bands and we have identified 10 high\\ndensity clumps in the region. The physical properties of the clumps such as\\ntemperature: 14.3-22.3 K and mass: 87-1530 M_sun are determined by fitting a\\nmodified blackbody to the spectral energy distribution of each clump between\\n160 micron and 1.2 mm. The total mass of the IRDC is estimated to be $~4700\\nM_sun. The molecular line emission towards S1 reveals signatures of\\nprotostellar activity. Low frequency radio emission at 1300 and 610 MHz is\\ndetected towards S1 (shell-like) and S2 (compact morphology), confirming the\\npresence of newly formed massive stars in the IRDC. Photometric analysis of\\nnear and mid-infrared point sources unveil the young stellar object population\\nassociated with the cloud. Fragmentation analysis indicates that the filament\\nis supercritical. We observe a velocity gradient along the filament, that is\\nlikely to be associated with accretion flows within the filament rather than\\nrotation. Based on various age estimates obtained for objects in different\\nevolutionary stages, we attempt to set a limit to the current age of this\\ncloud.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 04:29:01 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2018-01-24\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Veena\",\"V.

On the other\\nhand, when $m$ is constant Chekuri et al.\\\\ (2010) showed a randomized\\n$(1-1/e)-\\\\epsilon$ approximation with runtime (number of queries to function\\noracle) $n^{m/\\\\epsilon^3}$. %In fact, the result of Chekuri et al.\\\\ (2010) is\\nfor the far more general case of matroid constant.\\n  We focus on finding a fast and practical algorithm that has (asymptotic)\\napproximation guarantees even when $m$ is super constant. We first modify the\\nalgorithm of Chekuri et al.\\\\ (2010) to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation for\\n$m=o(\\\\frac{k}{\\\\log^3 k})$. This demonstrates a steep transition from constant\\nfactor approximability to inapproximability around $m=\\\\Omega(k)$. Then using\\nMultiplicative-Weight-Updates (MWU), we find a much faster\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(n/\\\\delta^3)$ time asymptotic $(1-1/e)^2-\\\\delta$ approximation. While\\nthe above results are all randomized, we also give a simple deterministic\\n$(1-1/e)-\\\\epsilon$ approximation with runtime $kn^{m/\\\\epsilon^4}$. Finally, we\\nrun synthetic experiments using Kronecker graphs and find that our MWU inspired\\nheuristic outperforms existing heuristics.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 06:44:24 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v2\",\"created\":\"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 16:08:39 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v3\",\"created\":\"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:43:01 GMT\"},{\"version\":\"v4\",\"created\":\"Sat, 1 May 2021 18:12:22 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2021-05-04\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Udwani\",\"Rajan\",\"\"]]}",
