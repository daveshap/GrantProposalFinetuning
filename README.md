# Large Corpus Insights

Given a large volume of text (hundreds, thousands, or millions of documents) find ways to extract useful and meaningful insights. Here are some potential use-cases:

- **Research assistant** - Use powerful new semantic search to find hidden or non-obvious connections between research.
- **Knowledge graph** - Render massive amounts of data as a web of linkages for rapid traversal and visualization.
- **Interactive data** - Create a QA platform that allows for arbitrary questions and answers.
- **Finetuned generation** - Rapidly produce novel content such as research papers, grant proposals, or academic texts.
- **Teaching aid** - Generate structured teaching material from an arbitrary corpus of data.
